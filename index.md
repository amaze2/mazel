I am the <a href="https://www.union.edu/schaffer-library/staff-departments/adam-mazel" target="_blank">Digital Scholarship and Instruction Librarian</a> at 
<a href="https://www.union.edu/" target="_blank">Union College</a> in Schenectady, NY. 
My responsibilities include helping Union use digital media to advance and open its scholarship and teaching.

My M.S. in Library and Information Science is from <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/" target="_blank">Simmons University</a> (2019), 
where I focused on digital technology, and my Ph.D. in English Language and Literature is from the 
<a href="http://umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> (2014), 
where I specialized in Victorian poetry.

My publications are on topics ranging from Victorian poetry, to the digital humanities, to the archival profession. 
My peer-reviewed articles on Victorian literature have appeared in
<i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1060150316000073" target="_blank">Victorian Literature and Culture</a></i>,
<i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/vp.2017.0008" target="_blank">Victorian Poetry</a></i>, and
<i><a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/ncl.2017.72.3.374" target="_blank">Nineteenth-Century Literature</a></i>,
and I write the annual "Guide to the Year's Work" on Algernon Charles Swinburne for
<i><a href="https://wvupressonline.com/journals/victorian_poetry" target="_blank">Victorian Poetry</a></i>.

My hobbies include exercise. I have completed nine marathons, including New York, Chicago, and Boston, with a personal best of 3:02 (2012).
